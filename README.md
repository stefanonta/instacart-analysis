# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
## Data Analysis Project using Python

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the
same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect
on the sale of their products.  

The analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to
ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. 

**The stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions**:  

- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders

- Need to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

**The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.**

- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?
  
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
 
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?

- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

- What differences in the ordering habits of different customer
profiles?
